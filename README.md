# Keras RetinaNet
Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) In the repository, execute `pip install .`. Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed, this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that through `pip` (which at least on Arch linux results in an incorrect installation). Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements. Also, make sure Keras 2.0.9 or above is installed as this package uses some features of 2.0.9.
3) As of writing, this repository requires the `master` version of `keras-resnet` for freezing `BatchNormalization` layers (ie. clone [this](https://github.com/broadinstitute/keras-resnet) repository and run `pip install .` in that repository).

## Training
An example on how to train `keras-retinanet` can be found [here](https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/examples/train_coco.py).

### Usage
For training on [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), run:
```
python examples/train_pascal.py <path to VOCdevkit/VOC2007>
```

For training on [MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home), run:
```
python examples/train_coco.py <path to MS COCO>
```

In general, the steps to train on your own datasets are:
1) Create a model by calling `keras_retinanet.models.ResNet50RetinaNet` and compile it. Empirically, the following compile arguments have been found to work well:
```
model.compile(
    loss={
        'regression'    : keras_retinanet.losses.regression_loss,
        'classification': keras_retinanet.losses.focal_loss()
    },
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.adam(lr=1e-5, clipnorm=0.001)
)
```
2) Create generators for training and testing data (an example is show in [`keras_retinanet.preprocessing.PascalVocIterator`](https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/preprocessing/pascal_voc.py)). These generators should generate an image batch (shaped `(batch_id, height, width, channels)`) and a target batch (shaped `(batch_id, num_anchors, 5)`). Currently, a limitation is that `batch_size` must be equal to `1`.
3) Use `model.fit_generator` to start training.

## Testing
An example of testing the network can be seen in [this Notebook](https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/examples/ResNet50RetinaNet%20-%20COCO%202017.ipynb). In general, output can be retrieved from the network as follows:
```
_, _, detections = model.predict_on_batch(inputs)
```

Where `detections` are the resulting detections, shaped `(None, None, 4 + num_classes)` (for `(x1, y1, x2, y2, bg, cls1, cls2, ...)`).

Execution time on NVIDIA Pascal Titan X is roughly 55msec for an image of shape `1000x600x3`.

## Results

### MS COCO
The MS COCO model can be downloaded [here](https://delftrobotics-my.sharepoint.com/personal/h_gaiser_fizyr_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=1d51021426e7147fb89bc534671ae50aa&authkey=AXOvo1KqF_NU8QmP5pP1QUo&e=c2a23915773a4cf7bd3b8fff8bc18803). Results using the `cocoapi` are shown below (note: according to the paper, this configuration should achieve a mAP of 0.34).

```
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.306
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.485
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.75      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.323
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.131
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.336
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.439
 Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=  1 ] = 0.274
 Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets= 10 ] = 0.410
 Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.422
 Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.217
 Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.467
 Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.591
```
